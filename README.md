==========

This repository holds the reusable visual content the dorm produces. Examples include stylized versions of the building, icons used for tech projects, etc.
For space, readability, and re-usability purposes, it is highly preferred that vector, not bitmaps, be uploaded. Where possible, images should be save in a standard SVG format to ensure that they can be opened by all members of tech.
